## Getting started


Begin by logging into VM:

```
ssh -X ubuntu@137.205.69.49
```

May need this:
```
source .profile 
```

Discussion point environment variables and configuration files.

Some useful repositories should already be on the system (do not run the following):


~mkdir ~/repos~

~~cd repos~~

~~ git clone https://github.com/chrisquince/WorkshopSept2017.git ~~


and another two we will need:
```
~~git clone https://github.com/chrisquince/MAGAnalysis.git~~
~~git clone https://github.com/chrisquince/StrainMetaSim.git~~
```

Then we make ourselves a Projects directory:

```
mkdir ~/Projects
mkdir ~/Projects/AD
cd ~/Projects/AD
mkdir Reads
cd Reads
```

### Downloading the raw sequence reads

and download the anaerobic digester sequences:
```
cut -d"," -f7 ~/repos/WorkshopSept2017/data/metaFP1B.csv | sed '1d' > ForwardURL.txt
cut -d"," -f8 ~/repos/WorkshopSept2017/data/metaFP1B.csv | sed '1d' > ReverseURL.txt
```

```
while read line
do
    wget $line
done <  ForwardURL.txt
```

Can you work out how to download the reverse reads?

### Fastq file format

The reads are stored as pairs of fastq files.
```
head -n 10 S102_R1.fastq
```
Sometimes these will be zipped.

Lets have a look at the wikipedia page on [fastq format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format).

Count up number of reads in a fastq file:
```
cat S102_R1.fastq | echo $((`wc -l`/4))
```

What will the number be in S102_R2.fastq?

Discussion point: What are paired end reads?

Lets counts up reads in all files:
```
for file in *_R1.fastq; do cat $file | echo $((`wc -l`/4)); done > Counts.txt
```

And plot histogram, median read number is 4,917,354:
```
R
>library(ggplot2)
>Counts <- read.csv('Counts.txt',header=FALSE)
>summary(Counts$V1)
>pdf("Counts.pdf")
>qplot(Counts$V1, geom="histogram") 
>dev.off()
>q()
```

Now we run fastqc on one of the samples:
```
fastqc S102_R1.fastq
```

Look at the output files:
```
ls
firefox S102_R1_fastqc.html
